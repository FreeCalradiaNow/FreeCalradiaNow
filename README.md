👋 Hi, I’m 
### **@FreeCalradiaNow**
aka FreeCalradia

👀  I´m interested in .Net development with C# using MVVM, Python and Neural Nets, Databases and SQL. I´m looking forward to look into Unity and behind PowerShell.

🌱 I’m currently learning **C#**, **SQL**, **Unit Testing**, **Subnetting**, **Html**, **Python** and **C++** ...

💞️ I’m searching for low-key participation at **Mount & Blade modding projects** and i am interested in **small low skill A.I. related projects** ...

📫 How to reach me ... isn´t here any mailing function? But I cant´t imagine why anyboy who (isReadingThis && !hasMyDetails) may need reach me - to be accurate i can´t even imagine anybody who !isME reading this at all in the first place.
